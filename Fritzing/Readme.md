# Fritzing

Fritzing open source tool is widely used to design electronic projects and draw graphical schematics for different hardware prototypes. To build the part, an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) has been designed for mosaicHAT. It's uploaded in this directory and could be used to design spin-off mosaic boards (SVGs function as working files in design tools, e.g. Adobe Illustrator and Inkspace).
